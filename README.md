# Slim Pastel

Everything I need to start coding a small react app as fast as possible.
Just like everything else, this is a **work in progress**,  but I'm not a fan of big boilerplate projects and like to know what's going on behind the scenes.

## What is necessary for me to jump start:
- Webpack
- React + Redux
- SASS
- TDD Tools (using Jest as of now)

## To get up and running

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Be happy

## Scripts
- `npm run start`: Run webpack dev server in dev mode with Hot Reload and un-minified html/js.
- `npm run build`: Run webpack in prod mode, minifying everything on dist/ folder, which is generated.
- `npm run test`: Runs all tests
